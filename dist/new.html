        <p>For New Teachers</p>
        <p>Beginning in September 2018, the New Teacher Induction Program (NTIP) expanded to include mentorship with
          experienced teachers. There are links to that program below, however this section will only deal with TPAs for
          new teachers.</p>
        <p>For the appraisal system, a new teacher is defined as someone who has recently signed a permanent contract
          (either part-time or full-time) and is now working in their school/centre. All new teachers must have 2 TPAs
          within the first 12 months of employment.</p>

        Appendix F Log of Teaching Practice for New Teachers (Optional Form)
      </header>
      <article class="quote">
        <p>How is the Log of Teaching Practice used?</p>

        <p>The Log of Teaching Practice is an optional resource for principals and/or teachers that may be used as a
          regularly kept record of demonstrations of teaching. It can provide a vehicle for chronicling noteworthy
          examples of teaching and learning events as they occur. The log uses a standardized format for recording.
          Entries are restricted to facts so that data are objective. Analysis and interpretation follow the collection
          of log data.</p>
      </article>
      <div class="advice">
        <p>As the title of this section implies, the form itself is optional.</p>
        <p>Reading the first sentence of the “How is the Log of Teaching Practice used?” is very clear. This is an
          optional resource for you and/or your principal to use over a longer period of time than the few days that you
          are being observed (eg. ‘examples…as they occur’). It is a ‘timestamp’ style form that can be used by either
          party to indicate your continued effort towards a class, project or overall curriculum idea.</p>
        <p><strong>***You do not have to use this long form leading up to your TPA*** </strong></p>
        <p>How you keep your lesson plans is based on your board policy and your own practice. You are only required to
          produce a lesson plan for the day of the observation. You are not required to keep a continuous written log of
          your teaching practice and growth.</p>
        <p>If the admin decides that’s they want to use this form, you cannot stop them, but you should not be forced to
          give them the evidence they need. They have to see and record the competency for this to be a genuine
          resource, not you.</p>
        <p><strong><i>Disclaimer:</i></strong> Make sure you know and understand your board’s policy on creating and
          keeping lesson plans. That is the only one you have to follow. If you feel the process is your burden, contact
          your union representative. </p>

        <p>This is a shortened list from the manual and ones that I used or often saw in my secondary experience. The
          complete list of items spans classrooms from K-12. </p>
        <p>It is important that you understand that no administrator can <i>demand</i> that you produce any type of
          evidence. I believe that this list is here to provide the teacher or administrator with some examples of
          possible evidence. The principal needs to collect the proof from the pre-observation discussion, the classroom
          observation or the post-observation <i>discussions</i>.</p>
        <p>Check the Competency Table for my comments for places when the admin should gather specific types of
          evidence. </p>

      <article class="quote">
        <p>In accordance with the regulations, all performance appraisals must include the following

        <ul>
          <li>a pre-observation meeting;</li>
          <li>a classroom observation;</li>
          <li>a post-observation meeting;</li>
          <li>a summative report that includes a rating of the teacher’s overall performance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In instances where a teacher’s performance appraisal results in a Development Needed or
          Unsatisfactory rating, additional steps are required. For further details please refer to
          section 12, “Procedures Following a Performance Rating”.</p>
      </article>
      <p class="advice">This is all you have to do. In short, go to a meeting for a discussion, have the administrator
        in a specific class for a specific lesson for the entire time frame, go to another meeting for another
        discussion and then sign the report (even if you don’t agree with it, you must sign it).</p>

        <p>The teacher and principal must have a pre-observation meeting to prepare for the classroom

        <p>The principal and the teacher use the pre-observation meeting to:</p>

      </article>
      <p class="advice">The second point says it all – “promote a collegial atmosphere”. This should be a collegial
        process, not an “I got you!”. If you can, schedule the meeting to be 1 hour at the most. Before the meeting,
        decide which lesson you would like them to observe. Take a copy of the lesson plan they will see. In this
        meeting, talk about where this lesson fits in the curriculum, what you expect might happen and how you evaluate
        that skill at the end of the unit.</p>

        Section 10.2.3 The Classroom Observation
      </header>
      <article class="quote">
        <p>To assess teachers’ skills, knowledge, and attitudes, each appraisal must include at least one
          classroom observation. For the purposes of the performance appraisal, each teacher must be
          observed in an instructional setting. With the exception of the teaching assignments summarized
          below, the classroom observation involves a visit by the principal to the teacher’s classroom.
          However, the definition of “classroom observation” in O. Reg. 99/02 addresses those
          circumstances in which a teacher’s usual teaching environment is not a classroom. For such
          teachers, classroom observation includes observation of the teacher in his or her ordinary
          teaching environment. For teachers such as physical education teachers, special education
          teachers, or guidance counsellors, the ordinary teaching environment would include,
          respectively, the gymnasium, a regular classroom where the special education teacher is working
          with particular students, or a guidance office or small-group setting where the counsellor is
          interacting with students.</p>
      </article>
      <p class="advice">As a new teacher, you may have been given a number of assignments that you are not listed as
        qualifications on your OCT record. You can only be appraised teaching a lesson you are qualified to teach, if
        it’s not on your OCT, they cannot schedule it for a TPA. Choose a lesson that you know the students will be
        engaged and active in their own learning. To help out the administrator, you could make sure all the
        competencies will be visible for them to gather their evidence.</p>

        Section 10.2.4 The Post-Observation Meeting
      </header>
      <article class="quote">
        <p>After the classroom observation, the teacher and principal must meet to review the results of the
          observation and discuss other information relevant to the principal’s appraisal of the teacher’s
          performance. The post-observation meeting should be held as soon as possible after the classroom
          observation. During the post-observation meeting, the teacher and principal must:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>discuss the competencies that they consider to be most relevant to the teacher’s performance
            appraisal. The principal will then comment on these competencies in the summative report.
            For new teachers, this will involve a comment on each of the eight competencies identified
            as essential to the appraisal of new teachers
            (see Table 2 in section 5, “Competencies”);</li>
          <li>discuss the teacher’s participation in the NTIP and their professional growth strategies
            (for new teachers only);</li>

        </ul>
      </article>
      <p class="advice">If possible, schedule this immediately after the observation and have it in your classroom. The
        lesson just presented will be fresh in your mind and the discussion will be more focused. This is a discussion,
        you do not have to produce any evidence. If they didn’t see it in the lesson you can discuss how you would
        demonstrate that in another lesson. This is supposed to be a collegial experience, you should be learning from
        each other.</p>

        <p>The Summative Report Forms for New and for Experienced Teachers
          (see Appendices A and B) are ministry-approved forms that must be used to document
          each teacher’s appraisal. The information they contain is summarized in the checklists that
          follow. </p>
        <p>The completed Summative Report Form for New Teachers must include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a record of meeting and classroom observation dates;</li>
          <li>the principal’s appraisal of the teacher’s performance, including comments on each of the
            eight competencies for new teachers (see Table 2 in section 5, “Competencies”);
          </li>
          <li>the principal’s indication of the induction elements in which the new teacher has

          <li>growth strategies if the teacher’s performance is rated as Satisfactory.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the case of both new and experienced teachers, the principal must collect evidence to support
          his or her appraisal of the teacher’s performance. This evidence must be either described in the
          summative report or attached as supporting documentation.</p>
        <p>The principal must sign the Summative Report Form and give the teacher a copy within 20 school
          days of the classroom observation. The teacher must sign the copy to acknowledge receipt and can
          add comments if he or she wishes. The principal must send a signed copy to the board through the
          appropriate supervisory officer.</p>
        <p>At the request of either party, the principal and teacher must meet to discuss the performance
          appraisal after the teacher receives a copy of the summative report.</p>
      </article>
      <div class="advice">
        <p>You have to sign it. That is one of the 14 “teacher must” occurrences in the TPA manual. Most boards use a
          computerized comment generated program so the report itself does not read well. </p>
        <p>As a new teacher you must have 2 appraisals in the first 12 months of your career. To get out of the NTIP you
          must receive 2 “Satisfactory” ratings in the first 24 months of your career.</p>
        <p>If you receive a “Development Needed” rating, your principal will extend your participation in the NTIP. It
          just means you will have to do an additional TPA. It also means that they have identified areas you need to
          improve, and they must provide additional supports and professional development for you to improve. They may
          do this through an “Enrichment Plan” that they will develop for you, hopefully with your input. See the NTIP
          document for more information.</p>
        <p>You cannot receive an “Unsatisfactory” rating unless you have already received a “Development Needed” rating.
          If this is the case, you need to improve your teaching practice. Find a mentor.</p>

          <p class="question">43. What happens in the post-observation meeting, and when does it take place?</p>
          <p>The post-observation meeting should take place as soon as possible after the classroom
            observation. The teacher and principal review the results of the classroom observation and
            discuss other information relevant to the principal’s appraisal of the teacher’s performance.
            During the post-observation meeting, the teacher and principal should:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Discuss</strong> the competencies they consider to be most relevant to the teacher’s
              performance appraisal;</li>
            <li>For new teachers, discuss the teacher’s participation in the NTIP; </li>
            <li><strong>Discuss</strong> and finalize the teacher’s professional growth goals and strategies
              and/ or the areas for improvement to be considered in the teacher’s learning plan (ALP, INS,
              or Enrichment/Improvement Plan);</li>
            <li>If the teacher wishes to do so, discuss how the teacher might gather parental and student
              input to inform development of his/her learning plan (ALP or INS).</li>
          </ul>
