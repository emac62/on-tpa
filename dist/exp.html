        <p>For Experienced Teachers</p>
        <p class="intro">The TPA process for experienced teachers has not undergone any changes since its introduction.
          Only in the minds of the administrators has there been an alteration, and this is the reason for this website.
          As years went along, I saw that teachers were experiencing an increase of anxiety and stress during their
          appraisal years. This seems counterintuitive to the purpose of the process. Our administrators are to provide
          guidance and educational leadership. How do we gain this if we are doing all the work and essentially
          providing our own report? What lay below are direct quotations from the manual and my advice for ensuring that
          you have a positive and informative TPA. To make this a practise that is personal and professional, you need
          to take change of the process.</p>
        <p class="quote">The principal must consider all 16 competencies when assessing the performance of experienced
          teachers. However, he or she does not have to comment on all 16 competencies in the summative
          report. The pre-observation meeting provides opportunities for principals and teachers to
          discuss which competencies should be the focus of the classroom observation and the appraisal.
          In the post observation meeting, they may discuss comments related to the competencies that are
          to be included in the summative report. <i>However,</i> the principal may comment on competencies
          other
          than those discussed and should advise the teacher of that fact during the discussions. </p>
        <p class="advice">Be sure to ask
          questions throughout as this will ensure that the process is interactive and collegial.</p>

          <li>a pre-observation meeting;</li>
          <li>a classroom observation;</li>

      </header>
      <article class="quote">
        <p>To assess teachers’ skills, knowledge, and attitudes, each appraisal must include at least one
          classroom observation. For the purposes of the performance appraisal, each teacher must be
          observed in an instructional setting. With the exception of the teaching assignments summarized
          below, the classroom observation involves a visit by the principal to the teacher’s classroom.
          However, the definition of “classroom observation” in O. Reg. 99/02 addresses those
          circumstances in which a teacher’s usual teaching environment is not a classroom. For such
          teachers, classroom observation includes observation of the teacher in his or her ordinary
          teaching environment. For teachers such as physical education teachers, special education
          teachers, or guidance counsellors, the ordinary teaching environment would include,
          respectively, the gymnasium, a regular classroom where the special education teacher is working
          with particular students, or a guidance office or small-group setting where the counsellor is
          interacting with students. The board may choose to establish protocols Performance Appraisal
          Procedures 31 for the performance appraisal of teachers, such as curriculum consultants, who are
          not routinely in an instructional setting with students, by using the mandated competencies and
          any additional competencies that the board may develop.</p>
      </article>
      <div class="advice">
        <p>***Make sure that you have the qualification on your OCT for the class chosen for observation*** </p>
        <p>The administrator cannot assess you teaching a subject you are not qualified to teach. </p>
        <p>If you can, choose a lesson you have taught before and one which has the students actively engaged,
          to promote full class participation. If you have an expectation of lesson outcomes, then you will have
          a stronger and more engaging post-conversation with the administrator. </p>
        <p>Do not let the admin tell you when they will be observing. This is your appraisal and it is supposed
          to be a collaborative process. If necessary, give them a couple of dates to choose from as we all
          know, emergencies can happen on the prospective date.</p>

          (see Appendices A and B) are ministry-approved forms that must be used to document

        <p>In the case of both new and experienced teachers, the principal must collect evidence to support

          summative report or attached as supporting documentation.</p>
        <p>The principal must sign the Summative Report Form and give the teacher a copy within 20 school
          days of the classroom observation. The teacher must sign the copy to acknowledge receipt and can
          add comments if he or she wishes. The principal must send a signed copy to the board through the
          appropriate supervisory officer.</p>
        <p>At the request of either party, the principal and teacher must meet to discuss the performance
          appraisal after the teacher receives a copy of the summative report.</p>
      </article>
      <div class="advice">
        <p>It is the administrator's job to complete this report in its entirety. You as the teacher are only
          required to sign the report. The contents of this should have been discussed at the post-observation
          meeting. If you don't agree with what is there, a discussion with the administrator is necessary. Try
          to be objective about your performance and demonstrate your professional standard. If they refuse to
          change the wording, you still have to sign it.</p>
        <p>If you get an “Unsatisfactory” rating, a new set of guidelines and procedures will apply. See Section
          12.3.2 of the TPA manual. </p>
        <p>Basically, they must:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>develop a plan for your improvement within 15 days of the Unsatisfactory rating</li>
          <li>you must follow that plan and participate (in the same manner) another TPA within 60 school days
            of receiving the improvement plan </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Hopefully they will consult you on the plan and provide you with a mentor. If you feel you are being
          bullied, contact your federation/association representative to help you through the process. </p>

              performance appraisal.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The pre-observation meeting also provides an opportunity to discuss the experienced teacher’s
            Annual Learning Plan.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="advice">
          <p>The emphasis above is mine. </p>
          <p>This is your opportunity to tell your administrator all about the course and how you are teaching
            it - they have to listen to you! This should be the most enjoyable part of the process. Your
            attitude here can change how an administrator sees you and your efforts. I have seen funding come
            from these meetings!</p>
          <p>This is also the same as Section 10.2.2. The order and wording is slightly different, for those of
            you looking for that.</p>

          <p class="question">43. What happens in the post-observation meeting, and when does it take place?</p>
          <p>The post-observation meeting should take place as soon as possible after the classroom
            observation. The teacher and principal review the results of the classroom observation and
            discuss other information relevant to the principal’s appraisal of the teacher’s performance.
            During the post-observation meeting, the teacher and principal should:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Discuss</strong> the competencies they consider to be most relevant to the teacher’s
              performance appraisal;</li>
            <li><strong>Discuss</strong> and finalize the teacher’s professional growth goals and strategies
              and/ or the areas for improvement to be considered in the teacher’s learning plan (ALP, INS,
              or Enrichment/Improvement Plan);</li>
            <li>If the teacher wishes to do so, discuss how the teacher might gather parental and student
              input to inform development of his/her learning plan (ALP or INS).</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="advice">
          <p>Again, the emphasis is mine. </p>
          <p>This is a discussion, not an assignment submission! My last TPA occurred in my last semester of
            teaching. I happened to have a prep right after the class so we just sat down in my room and
            discussed what happened. When asked about a specific competency that was not shown in the lesson, I
            was able to open up my desk files and show (not give) the administrator proof that I had that
            covered. An example of this could be a log of parent contact or to highlight something specific in
            your teaching space.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="quote">
          <p class="question">45. Can a principal include comments on competencies that were not previously
            identified during
            the pre-observation meeting?</p>
          <p>For appraisals of <i>experienced</i> teachers, a principal can provide comments on any of the
            competencies set out in Schedule 1 of O. Reg. 99/02, even if they weren’t discussed at the
            pre-observation meeting, if the principal thinks it is appropriate to do so in light of the
            classroom observation. However, principals should discuss these additions with the teacher
            during the post-observation meeting, so that the additions will not come as a surprise when the
            teacher receives the summative report.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="advice">
          <p>This specifically says that the summative report should not be a surprise. All aspects should have
            been covered in the post-observation meeting. </p>
          <p>If you think that you will have another TPA with this same administrator sometime in the future,
            take the time to read the whole document. They should have spent several hours completing this
            rating and, to be collegial, taking time to review it carefully builds trust between professionals.
