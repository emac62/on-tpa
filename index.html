        <h3>TPAs - My Story</h3>
      </header>
      <div class="intro">
        <p>Please note, the TPA manual has not changed since 2010.</p>
        <p>
          I was lucky. When TPAs were first legislated in Ontario, I had a
          good relationship with my principal. He approached me and asked if
          we could learn about it together. The experience was one of the
          highlights of my career. I always looked forward to my TPA which is
          why it pains me that in the last few years young teachers have been
          extremely and unnecessarily stressed about the process.
          Unfortunately most teachers see it as a lot of work. When I asked
          deeper questions I began to realize that administrators were
          downloading their responsibility and work to the individual teacher.
          That is wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the TPA manual, there are only 14 references to “teacher must”
          and that includes both new and experienced teacher references. If
          you search for “principal must”, well, that appears 43 times.
        </p>

      <div class="quote">
        <p>
          In the case of both new and experienced teachers, the principal must
          collect evidence to support his or her appraisal of the teacher's
          performance. This evidence must be either described in the summative
          report or attached as supporting documentation.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="advice">
        <p>
          It does not say the teacher must submit evidence of competency, you
          cannot assess yourself. The administrator must collect the evidence
          through observation and discussions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only documentation provided by the teacher is the Annual
          Learning Plan and the lesson plan for the observation. To be
          collegial, a course outline, unit outline and how the lesson will be
          evaluated could be provided. None of these should be any extra work
          for the teacher. If the evaluation for the current unit has not been
          set, a discussion of that evaluation should happen in the
          post-observation meeting.
        </p>
        <p>
          The admin must comment on all 16 competencies and I'm sure some may
          find it hard to “concentrate” for the 75 minute observation class,
          but it is their job to comment on all of them, not the teachers. If
          they don't see it in your teaching you should discuss it at the post
          observation meeting. You do not need to provide them with anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          The admin cannot threaten you with an unsatisfactory if you do not
          hand in a binder of evidence. Call your federation/association/union
          rep to grieve this.

          Ministry's TPA manual along with my comments about the experiences I
          had as a secondary teacher.
